TODO: Add Scout system.
- `/scout follow <@userID>`
  - Allows FM to get notified when a players queue pop.
  - They will get a DM from the bot with a link to the lobby VC (Nearly the same as the player version)
- `/scout unfollow <@userID>`
  - Unfolows the FM from a specified player. 
- `/scout list`
  - Gives the FM the list of players they are following.

TODO: Check amount of games and change their priority to lowest possible.
- Low Priority
  - May multiply queues to 6 per tier
